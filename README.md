# Cowin-Slot-Notifier
Notifies you by playing a sound when a slot of your choice opens up in CoWin. Made with Python and CoWin API.

To use this, make sure you have python installed and run the file named 'cowin slot notifier.py'.
You may have to install a few libraries, you can do that by 'pip install nameOfLibrary' in your environment.\

While running the file, you may notice a pygame message being displayed, that's because I used the pygame library for the audio. If you want to remove that go to the pygame's installation site, then open '\_\_init\_\_.py' and comment out the last 2 line.\

Enjoy this program!\
